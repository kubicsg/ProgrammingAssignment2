## This function is used in the Coursera course "R Programming" as the exercise for week 2
## The function calculates (and caches for future usage) the matrix inverse 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
